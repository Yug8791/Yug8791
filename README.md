# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Yug Srivastav

## About Me
Hey there! I'm **Yug Srivastav**, a tech enthusiast with a knack for solving complex problems and exploring the limitless potential of **Computer Science**. Whether itâ€™s coding up a storm, diving into algorithms, or pushing the boundaries of research, Iâ€™m always up for a challenge.

With a keen interest in **software engineering**, **emerging technologies**, and a bit of international diplomacy thrown into the mix (thanks to my fascination with global affairs!), Iâ€™m constantly learning, building, and striving to innovate.

From developing projects and exploring new frameworks to writing a research paper independently during my 12th grade, I thrive in environments where curiosity and creativity come together to drive results. I believe the future belongs to those who aren't afraid to ask "What if?"â€”and I'm determined to be one of those people.

When I'm not buried in code or research, you'll probably find me reading about world events, tinkering wit
